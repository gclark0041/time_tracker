# OCR Improvements for Time Tracker App

## Overview
Enhanced the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system to better handle both mobile app screenshots and tabular documents like labor collection reports.

## What Was Improved

### 1. **Enhanced Image Preprocessing**
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects if the image is a mobile app screenshot or a table document
- **Format-specific preprocessing**: 
  - **Mobile format**: Uses original method optimized for clean app interfaces
  - **Table format**: Uses adaptive thresholding and morphological operations for better table text recognition

### 2. **Improved OCR Configuration**
- Different Tesseract configurations based on image type:
  - **Mobile**: Uses PSM 6 (single text block) for app screens
  - **Table**: Uses PSM 6 with character whitelist for cleaner table parsing
  - **Enhanced character filtering**: Focuses on alphanumeric characters and common punctuation

### 3. **Advanced Table Structure Extraction**
- **Multi-pattern matching**: Uses 6+ different regex patterns to handle OCR variations
- **Component-based parsing**: Looks for all required elements (order number, dates, times, hours) in each line
- **Intelligent cleanup**: Handles common OCR errors like O/0 confusion
- **Fallback system**: If standard patterns fail, uses advanced table extraction

### 4. **Enhanced Labor Collection Parser**
- **Flexible patterns**: Handles various spacing, punctuation, and OCR error variations
- **Employee name detection**: Extracts names from greetings like "Dear Greg Clark"
- **Robust datetime parsing**: Handles different time formats and date variations
- **Better debugging**: Comprehensive logging shows what was found/missed

## Supported Formats

```

## Testing Your Images

Use the new test utility to test your specific images:

```bash
# Test a specific image
python test_ocr.py path/to/your/image.png

# Test with specific format
python test_ocr.py path/to/your/image.png labor_collection
python test_ocr.py path/to/your/image.png punch_clocks

# Test all configured formats
python test_ocr.py
```

## Files Modified

1. **`image_processor.py`**
   - Enhanced `preprocess_image()` with format-specific preprocessing
   - Improved `extract_text_from_image()` with different OCR configs
   - Updated main parsing function to use enhanced methods

2. **`labor_collection_parser.py`**
   - Added `extract_table_structure()` for advanced table parsing
   - Enhanced pattern matching with 6+ regex variations
   - Added fallback system and better error handling

3. **`test_ocr.py`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive testing utility for both image formats
   - Detailed output showing what was extracted
   - Easy command-line interface

## Debugging Features

- **Full OCR text output**: See exactly what OCR extracted
- **Pattern matching details**: Shows which patterns matched/failed
- **Component analysis**: See what elements were found in each line
- **Debug files**: OCR text saved to files for analysis

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No entries extracted from labor collection report
- **Solution**: Check the debug OCR output file to see if text was extracted correctly
- **Try**: Use the table-specific format: `python test_ocr.py image.png labor_collection`

### Issue: Poor OCR quality
- **Solution**: Ensure image is high resolution (>1000px width recommended)
- **Try**: Take a clearer photo or screenshot with better lighting/contrast

### Issue: Order numbers not recognized
- **Solution**: The system handles O/0 confusion and various formats
- **Check**: Debug output to see if order numbers are detected with different patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Test with your specific images**: Use the test utility to see how well it works
2. **Fine-tune patterns**: If needed, add more regex patterns for your specific format variations
3. **Add more formats**: Easy to extend for other document types
